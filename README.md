You can use Stella Architect to explore the full model specification with multi-player capability and the graphical user interface. Simplified versions of the model are also available in the link above, which you can explore using Vensim or Python. The Python codes require some familiarity with coding and require some external packages to be installed. The simplified model does not include multi-player capability, and it only allows for one-shot decisions that are constant throughout the simulation period, unlike the actual experiments where subjects made decisions in each period (a total of 30 decisions for each subject). However, even the simplified model represents the underlying dynamics of orchard growth and groundwater depletion or recharge.

The repository also includes other information about the model, such as sensitivity analyses. We conducted two sets of sensitivity analyses based on the multiplayer model. First, we tested the sensitivity of the final value of profit with respect to all model constants except for the decision parameter. In the next round, we tested the sensitivity of the final value of orchards, groundwater, and profit by only varying the decision parameters. In both tests, the parameters, such as the decisions, were randomly drawn from their assumed boundaries. For the decision parameters, we increase the boundaries gradually to obtain more granular sensitivity results. See the sensitivity folder for the results.
