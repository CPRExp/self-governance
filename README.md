You can use Stella Architect to explore the full model specification with multi-player capability and the graphical user interface. Simplified versions of the model are also available in the link above, which you can explore using Vensim or Python. The Python codes require some familiarity with coding and require some external packages to be installed. The simplified model does not include multi-player capability, and it only allows for one-shot decisions that are constant throughout the simulation period, unlike the actual experiments where subjects made decisions in each period (a total of 30 decisions for each subject). However, even the simplified model represents the underlying dynamics of orchard growth and groundwater depletion or recharge.
